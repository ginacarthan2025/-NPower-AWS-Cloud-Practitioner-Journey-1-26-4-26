# 🚀 Pre-Course Prep – NPower AWS Cloud Practitioner Cohort

## 📌 Why I Joined the Program
-In January 2024, I was laid off from Mastercard, where I worked
as an IT professional. At the same time, my family needed support,
and I stepped into a full-time caregiving role. Although it was unexpected,
that season taught me patience, resilience, and the importance
of pouring into the people who once poured into me.

Being away from the tech industrcy for nearly two years
created a noticeable skills gap. Technology moves fast-
cloud computing, automation, AI, new security practices - and 
I realized that if I wanted to return to tech stronger and
more competitive, I needed structured training, hands-on experience,
and updated cloud skills.

That's why I applied to NPower's AWS Cloud Practitioner Program.

This program will give me the opportunity to
  -Rebuild my technical skillset
  -Strengthen my cloud and security foundation
  -Close the skills gap created during my time away
  -Re-enter the IT workforce prepared, confident, and certified
  -Transition into cloud, GRC, IAM or compliance roles.

After a challenging two years, joining NPower represents a fresh 
start for me - a chance to grow, upskill, reset and reclaim my career 
path while building a future for myself and my daughter.
